# linuxupdaterscript
focusing on fedora foremost, this product strives to soon be able to work on all major(arch based, debian based,fedora based) Linux distributions and- perhaps in the future- be able to allow seamless distro switching capabilities 
<h3>can i help?</h3>
yes. please be patient i am new to software maitnence 
<h3>i see that the project seems to be cli based.</h3>
for now we want to start with the CLI to see what all we can start with but a seprate project with a GUI will be develpoed soon. feel free to fork and develop a GUI version before i do
<h3>I don't like a certain aspect or design choice.</h3>
i've taken the liberty of using the gplv3 which allows free pulling and pushing of various parts. feel free to make a better version of this than I do (no credit needed) perhaps it may find it's way into the official repository
